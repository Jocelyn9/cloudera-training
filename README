Welcome to the Cloudera Training Exercise git repository!

This git repository contains all the code and instructions for the training
exercises used in Cloudera Hadoop training sessions. These are designed to
be conducted in the free training virtual machine available at:
  http://www.cloudera.com/hadoop-training-virtual-machine

You may, of course, run them wherever you'd like :)

For information about Cloudera's Hadoop training, visit:

- See the LICENSE file for information about Copyright and licensing.

- If you are inside the Cloudera virtual machine and would like to
  update this repository to the most recent version, run:

  $ ./update-exercises

  ... in this directory. This will also unpack the training database
into MySQL and set up your Eclipse environment. It is not recommended
that you run this script outside the Cloudera virtual machine. To get
the latest files without reconfiguring your broader development
environment, run:

  $ git pull
