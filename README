Welcome to the Cloudera Training Exercise git repository!

This git repository contains all the code and instructions for the training
exercises used in Cloudera Hadoop training sessions. These are designed to
be conducted in the free training virtual machine available at:
  http://www.cloudera.com/hadoop-training-virtual-machine

You may, of course, run them wherever you'd like :)

For information about Cloudera's Hadoop training, visit:

- See the LICENSE file for information about Copyright and licensing.

- If you are inside the Cloudera virtual machine and would like to
  update this repository to the most recent version, run:

  $ cd ~/git
  $ ./update-exercises

  ... in this directory. This will also unpack the training database
into MySQL and set up your Eclipse environment. It is not recommended
that you run this script outside the Cloudera virtual machine. To get
the latest files without reconfiguring your broader development
environment, run:

  $ git pull

- Many of these exercises use an Eclipse workspace. This will be deployed in
  the ~/workspace directory. If you would like to update the workspace, run:

  $ ./update-exercises --workspace

  Any existing workspace will be renamed to an alternate directory. You
  can redeploy the workspace without updating any other repository state
  by running "./update-exercises --workspace-only"

- Updates to the training repository are conveyed using the git protocol. If
  you cannot access git (e.g., due to a corporate firewall), you can specify
  that the script should attempt an http-based download by using:

  $ ./update-exercises --http

  This is a bit slower and more verbose, but usually does the trick.
