<p>This project is designed to familiarize you with the <b>Hive</b> data warehouse
system. In a previous exercise, we <a href="SqoopExercise.html">imported data from
a database into Hive</a>. We will now use Hive's SQL-like language to interact with this
data.</p>

<p>Much of this exercise is drawn from the lecture component. You may <a
href="../IntroToHive.pdf">review the slides for this</a> if you need to.</p> 

<p>You may also find the 
<a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/hive">Hive website</a> and
<a href="http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/Hive">wiki</a> useful references.</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>To log in to the Hive shell, run <tt>hive</tt> at the terminal. You should see
something like the following:
</p>

<div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="codeContent panelContent">
<pre class="code-java">
$ hive
Hive history file=/tmp/aaron/hive_job_log_aaron_200905271934_542324277.txt
hive&gt; 
</pre>
</div></div>


<hr>
<h2>Examining the Data</h2>

<p>You should have imported two tables of information from MySQL into Hive. You can
confirm that the tables are present by running:</p>

<div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="codeContent panelContent">
<pre class="code-java">
hive&gt; SHOW TABLES;
</pre>
</div></div>

<p>If the <tt>shake_freq</tt> and <tt>bible_freq</tt> tables aren't there, you should
run through the <a href="SqoopExercise.html">Sqoop exercise</a> now.</p>

<p>We can do some basic queries to view the data. For example, we can grab a set of
lines with a simple SELECT statement:</p>


<div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="codeContent panelContent">
<pre class="code-java">
hive&gt; SELECT * FROM shake_freq LIMIT 10;
</pre>
</div></div>

<p>This runs very quickly because we did not put any ordering or conditional (<tt>WHERE</tt>)
restrictions on the output, so it reads straight from HDFS. You can verify this by
running the same query, prepended with the <tt>EXPLAIN</tt> command:</p>

<div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="codeContent panelContent">
<pre class="code-java">
hive&gt; EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM shake_freq LIMIT 10;
</pre>
</div></div>

<p>We can conditionally show lines, and sort the output:</p>

<div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="codeContent panelContent">
<pre class="code-java">
hive&gt; SELECT * FROM shake_freq WHERE freq &gt; 100 SORT BY freq ASC LIMIT 10;
</pre>
</div></div>

<p>This query took a lot longer, because it actually involved running a MapReduce program.
You should <tt>EXPLAIN</tt> this query too, and note how its execution plan is much more
involved than the previous one.</p>

<p>Note that we use a <tt>SORT BY</tt>
clause instead of SQL's <tt>ORDER BY</tt> because it does not fully order the results;
it merely specifies the sorting criterion to use in each reducer. If you set the number
of reducers to 1 by running <tt>set mapred.reduce.tasks = 1</tt>, then <tt>SORT BY</tt>
acts like <tt>ORDER BY</tt>.</p>

<h2>Aggregate Functions</h2>

<p>Much like SQL's support for aggregations over groups of records, Hive's query language
has similar support for <tt>GROUP BY</tt> clauses and aggregate operators. The full list
is available in the Hive Query language reference in the Hive 
<a href="http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/Hive">wiki</a>.</p>

<p>You can determine which word frequency was most common (i.e., the <i>mode</i> frequency):</p>

<div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="codeContent panelContent">
<pre class="code-java">
hive&gt; SELECT freq, COUNT(1) AS f2 FROM shake_freq GROUP BY freq
    SORT BY f2 DESC LIMIT 10;
</pre>
</div></div>

<p>You can also determine the mean frequency using the <tt>avg()</tt> aggregate:</p>

<div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="codeContent panelContent">
<pre class="code-java">
hive&gt; SELECT avg(freq) FROM shake_freq; 
</pre>
</div></div>

<hr>
<h2>Joining Tables</h2>

<p>In addition to the Shakespeare data set, we have an identically-formatted dataset
regarding the frequency of words in the King James Bible. This should be represented
by a table named <tt>bible_freq</tt> that you imported as part of the
<a href="SqoopExercise.html">Sqoop exercise</a>.
</p>

<p>Let's do an inner join where we compare the frequency of a word in the Shakespeare
corpus and the bible corpus. We can <tt>SELECT</tt> data into a table, so that we can
manipulate that data in subsequent queries.</p>

<div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="codeContent panelContent">
<pre class="code-java">
hive&gt; CREATE TABLE merged (word STRING , shake_f INT, kjv_f INT);
hive&gt; INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE merged SELECT s.word, s.freq, b.freq
  FROM shake_freq s JOIN bible_freq b ON (s.word = b.word) 
  WHERE s.freq &gt;= 1 AND b.freq &gt;= 1;
</pre>
</div></div>

<p>Sanity check your output by reading some of it back:</p>
<div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="codeContent panelContent">
<pre class="code-java">
hive&gt; SELECT * FROM merged LIMIT 20;
</pre>
</div></div>

<p>What words appeared most frequently in both corpuses?
</p>
<div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="codeContent panelContent">
<pre class="code-java">
hive&gt; SELECT word, shake_f, kjv_f, (shake_f + kjv_f) AS ss
    FROM merged SORT BY ss DESC LIMIT 20;
</pre>
</div></div>

<hr/>
<h2>Extension 1: Relative Frequencies</h2>

<p>A problem with this result is that it does not take into account the relative sizes
of the two corpuses.  Design a set of queries that determine the <i>relative</i> frequencies
of words in their respective corpuses, and use this to calculate which words are the
most frequent across both corpuses. Do the results change dramatically if you take
this difference into account?
</p>

<hr/>

<h2>Extension 2: Related Words</h2>

<p>Goal: Determine which words occur in the same sentence.</p>

<p>This requires some more Hadoop-based data processing, which we've done for you
by writing a preprocessing
script. You'll need to run it to generate an intermediate dataset in HDFS. This script
creates an index from words to sentences. For each sentence a word appears in, it will
emit a record of the form <tt>word (tab) sentence_id</tt>. A <tt>sentence_id</tt> consists
of the first word of a sentence, a space, and a numeric hash code. For example, the input
<tt>One sentence. Another sentence.</tt> will yield the following output:
</p>

<div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="codeContent panelContent">
<pre class="code-java">
Another  Another 2050940439
One One 1502083882
sentence  Another 2050940439
sentence  One 1502083882
</pre>
</div></div>

<p>The preprocessing script is based on the inverted index code, and is written in python.
To run the script, execute:</p>

<div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="codeContent panelContent">
<pre class="code-java">
$ cd ~/git/exercises/shakespeare/sentence-idx
$ ./run-indexer input
</pre>
</div></div>

<p>This assumes that your Shakespeare data set has been loaded into the <tt>input</tt>
directory in HDFS. It will create its output in a directory called <tt>input_idx</tt>.
</p>

<p>You'll need to create a table in Hive to hold this data and load the results of the
MapReduce program into Hive. Then you'll need to use a join query to establish whether
a given pair of words is part of the same sentence.</p>

<h2>Solutions</h2>

<p>When you're done and want to check your work (or if you get stuck and need a hint),
solutions to both extensions are in the
