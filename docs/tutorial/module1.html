<h3>Problem Scope</h3>
<p>Hadoop is a large-scale distributed batch processing
infrastructure. While it can be used on a single machine, its true
power lies in its ability to scale to hundreds or thousands of
computers, each with several processor cores. Hadoop is also designed
to efficiently distribute large amounts of work across a set of
machines.</p>
<p><b>How large an amount of work?</b> Orders of
magnitude larger than many existing systems work with. Hundreds of
gigabytes of data constitute the <i>low end</i> of Hadoop-scale.
Actually Hadoop is built to process "web-scale" data on the order of
hundreds of gigabytes to terabytes or petabytes. At this scale, it is
likely that the input data set will not even fit on a single computer's
hard drive, much less in memory. So Hadoop includes a distributed file
system which breaks up input data and sends fractions of the original
data to several machines in your cluster to hold. This results in the
problem being processed in parallel using all of the machines in the
cluster and computes output results as efficiently as possible.</p>

<a name="challenges"> </a>
<h4 class="sectionSubH">Challenges at Large Scale</h4>
<p>Performing large-scale computation is
difficult. To work with this volume of data requires distributing parts
of the problem to multiple machines to handle in parallel. Whenever
multiple machines are used in cooperation with one another, the
probability of failures rises. In a single-machine environment, failure
is not something that program designers explicitly worry about very
often: if the machine has crashed, then there is no way for the program
to recover anyway.</p>

<p>In a distributed environment, however, partial
failures are an expected and common occurrence. Networks can experience
partial or total failure if switches and routers break down. Data may
not arrive at a particular point in time due to unexpected network
congestion. Individual compute nodes may overheat, crash, experience
hard drive failures, or run out of memory or disk space. Data may be
corrupted, or maliciously or improperly transmitted. Multiple
implementations or versions of client software may speak slightly
different protocols from one another. Clocks may become desynchronized,
lock files may not be released, parties involved in distributed atomic
transactions may lose their network connections part-way through, etc.
In each of these cases, the rest of the distributed system should be
able to recover from the component failure or transient error condition
and continue to make progress. Of course, actually providing such
resilience is a major software engineering challenge.</p>

<p>Different distributed systems specifically
address certain modes of failure, while worrying less about others.
Hadoop provides no security model, nor safeguards against maliciously
inserted data. For example, it cannot detect a man-in-the-middle attack
between nodes. On the other hand, it is designed to handle hardware
failure and data congestion issues very robustly. Other distributed
systems make different trade-offs, as they intend to be used for
problems with other requirements (e.g., high security).</p>

<p>In addition to worrying about these sorts of
bugs and challenges, there is also the fact that the compute hardware
has finite resources available to it. The major resources include:</p>

<ul>
  <li class="bullist">Processor time</li>
  <li class="bullist">Memory</li>
  <li class="bullist">Hard drive space</li>
  <li class="bullist">Network bandwidth</li>
</ul>
 

<p>Individual machines typically only have a few
gigabytes of memory. If the input data set is several terabytes, then
this would require a thousand or more machines to hold it in RAM -- and
even then, no single machine would be able to process or address all of
the data.</p>
 
<p>Hard drives are much larger; a single machine
can now hold multiple terabytes of information on its hard drives. But
intermediate data sets generated while performing a large-scale
computation can easily fill up several times more space than what the
original input data set had occupied. During this process, some of the
hard drives employed by the system may become full, and the distributed
system may need to route this data to other nodes which can store the
overflow.</p>
 
<p>Finally, bandwidth is a scarce resource even on
an internal network. While a set of nodes directly connected by a
gigabit Ethernet may generally experience high throughput between them,
if all of the machines were transmitting multi-gigabyte data sets, they
can easily saturate the switch's bandwidth capacity. Additionally if
the machines are spread across multiple racks, the bandwidth available
for the data transfer would be much less. Furthermore RPC requests and
other data transfer requests using this channel may be delayed or
dropped.</p>
 
<p>To be successful, a large-scale distributed
system must be able to manage the above mentioned resources
efficiently. Furthermore, it must allocate some of these resources
toward maintaining the system as a whole, while devoting as much time
as possible to the actual core computation.</p>
 
<p>Synchronization between multiple machines
remains the biggest challenge in distributed system design. If nodes in
a distributed system can explicitly communicate with one another, then
application designers must be cognizant of risks associated with such
communication patterns. It becomes very easy to generate more remote
procedure calls (RPCs) than the system can satisfy! Performing
multi-party data exchanges is also prone to deadlock or race
conditions. Finally, the ability to continue computation in the face of
failures becomes more challenging. For example, if 100 nodes are
present in a system and one of them crashes, the other 99 nodes should
be able to continue the computation, ideally with only a small penalty
proportionate to the loss of 1% of the computing power. Of course, this
will require re-computing any work lost on the unavailable node.
Furthermore, if a complex communication network is overlaid on the
distributed infrastructure, then determining how best to restart the
lost computation and propagating this information about the change in
network topology may be non trivial to implement.</p>

<a name="moore"> </a>
<h4 class="sectionSubH">Moore's Law</h4>

<p>So why use a distributed system at all? They seem
like more trouble than they're worth. And with the fast pace of
computer hardware design, it seems inevitable that single-chip hardware
will be able to "grow up" to handle the larger volumes of data. After
all, Moore's Law (named after Gordon Moore, the founder of Intel)
states that <b>the number of transistors that can be placed in a
processor will double approximately every two years, for half the cost.</b>
But trends in chip design are changing to face new realities. While we
can still double the number of transistors per unit area at this pace,
this does not necessarily result in faster single-threaded performance.
New processors such as Intel Core 2 and Itanium 2 architectures now
focus on embedding <b>many smaller CPUs</b> or "cores" onto the same
physical device. This allows multiple threads to process twice as much
data in parallel, but at the same speed at which they operated
previously.</p>
 

<p>Even if hundreds or thousands of CPU cores are
placed on a single machine, it would not be possible to deliver input
data to these cores fast enough for processing. Individual hard drives
can only sustain read speeds between 60-100 MB/second. These speeds
have been increasing over time, but not at the same breakneck pace as
processors. Optimistically assuming the upper limit of 100 MB/second,
and assuming four independent I/O channels are available to the
machine, that provides 400 MB of data every second. A 4 terabyte data
set would thus take over 10,000 seconds to read--about three hours just
to load the data! With 100 separate machines each with two I/O channels
on the job, this drops to three minutes.</p>

<a name="hadoop"> </a>
<h3>The Hadoop Approach</h3>
 
<p>Hadoop is designed to efficiently process large
volumes of information by connecting many commodity computers together
to work in parallel. The theoretical 1000-CPU machine described earlier
would cost a very large amount of money, far more than 1,000 single-CPU
or 250 quad-core machines. Hadoop will tie these smaller and more
reasonably priced machines together into a single cost-effective
compute cluster.</p>

<a name="comparison"> </a>
<h4 class="sectionSubH">Comparison to Existing Techniques</h4>

<p>Performing computation on large volumes of data
has been done before, usually in a distributed setting. What makes
Hadoop unique is its <b>simplified programming model</b> which allows
the user to quickly write and test distributed systems, and its <b>efficient,
automatic distribution of data and work across machines</b> and in turn
utilizing the underlying parallelism of the CPU cores.</p>
 
<p>Grid scheduling of computers can be done with
existing systems such as Condor. But Condor does not automatically
distribute data: a separate SAN must be managed in addition to the
compute cluster. Furthermore, collaboration between multiple compute
nodes must be managed with a communication system such as MPI. This
programming model is challenging to work with and can lead to the
introduction of subtle errors.</p>

<a name="data"> </a>
<h4 class="sectionSubH">Data Distribution</h4>

 
<p>In a Hadoop cluster, data is distributed to all the
nodes of the cluster as it is being loaded in. The Hadoop Distributed
File System (HDFS) will split large data files into chunks which are
managed by different nodes in the cluster. In addition to this each
chunk is replicated across several machines, so that a single machine
failure does not result in any data being unavailable. An active
monitoring system then re-replicates the data in response to system
failures which can result in partial storage. Even though the file
chunks are replicated and distributed across several machines, they
form a single namespace, so their contents are universally accessible.</p>
 
<p>Data is conceptually <b>record-oriented</b> in the
Hadoop programming framework. Individual input files are broken into
lines or into other formats specific to the application logic. Each
process running on a node in the cluster then processes a subset of
these records. The Hadoop framework then schedules these processes in
proximity to the location of data/records using knowledge from the
distributed file system. Since files are spread across the distributed
file system as chunks, each compute process running on a node operates
on a subset of the data. Which data operated on by a node is chosen
based on its locality to the node: most data is read from the local
disk straight into the CPU, alleviating strain on network bandwidth and
preventing unnecessary network transfers. This strategy of <b>moving
computation to the data</b>, instead of moving the data to the
computation allows Hadoop to achieve high data locality which in turn
results in high performance. </p>

<p><i>Figure 1.1: Data is distributed across nodes at
load time.</i></p>
 </div>

 <a name="#mapreduce"> </a>
<h4 class="sectionSubH">MapReduce: Isolated Processes</h4>
 
<p>Hadoop limits the amount of communication which
can be performed by the processes, as each individual record is
processed by a task in isolation from one another. While this sounds
like a major limitation at first, it makes the whole framework much
more reliable. Hadoop will not run just any program and distribute it
across a cluster. Programs must be written to conform to a particular
programming model, named "MapReduce."</p>
 
<p>In MapReduce, records are processed in
isolation by tasks called <i>Mappers</i>. The output from the Mappers
is then brought together into a second set of tasks called <i>Reducers</i>,
where results from different mappers can be merged together.</p>

 
<div style="text-align: center;"> <img src="resource/3529959486_8f36fb28c5_o.png" alt="mapreduce-process"> 
<p><i>Figure 1.2: Mapping and reducing tasks run
on nodes where individual records of data are already present.</i></p>
 </div>
 
<p>Separate nodes in a Hadoop cluster still
communicate with one another. However, in contrast to more conventional
distributed systems where application developers explicitly marshal
byte streams from node to node over sockets or through MPI buffers,
communication in Hadoop is performed <i>implicitly</i>. Pieces of data
can be tagged with key names which inform Hadoop how to send related
bits of information to a common destination node. Hadoop internally
manages all of the data transfer and cluster topology issues.</p>
 

<p>By restricting the communication between nodes,
Hadoop makes the distributed system much more reliable. Individual node
failures can be worked around by restarting tasks on other machines.
Since user-level tasks do not communicate explicitly with one another,
no messages need to be exchanged by user programs, nor do nodes need to
roll back to pre-arranged checkpoints to partially restart the
computation. The other workers continue to operate as though nothing
went wrong, leaving the challenging aspects of partially restarting the
program to the underlying Hadoop layer.</p>

<a name="scalability"></a>
<h4 class="sectionSubH">Flat Scalability</h4>
 
<p>One of the major benefits of using Hadoop in
contrast to other distributed systems is its flat scalability curve.
Executing Hadoop on a limited amount of data on a small number of nodes
may not demonstrate particularly stellar performance as the overhead
involved in starting Hadoop programs is relatively high. Other
parallel/distributed programming paradigms such as MPI (Message Passing
Interface) may perform much better on two, four, or perhaps a dozen
machines. Though the effort of coordinating work among a small number
of machines may be better-performed by such systems, the price paid in
performance and engineering effort (when adding more hardware as a
result of increasing data volumes) increases non-linearly.</p>
 
<p> A program written in distributed frameworks
other than Hadoop may require large amounts of refactoring when scaling
from ten to one hundred or one thousand machines. This may involve
having the program be rewritten several times; fundamental elements of
its design may also put an upper bound on the scale to which the
application can grow.</p>
 

<p>Hadoop, however, is specifically designed to
have a very flat scalability curve. After a Hadoop program is written
and functioning on ten nodes, very little--if any--work is required for
that same program to run on a much larger amount of hardware. Orders of
magnitude of growth can be managed with little re-work required for
your applications. The underlying Hadoop platform will manage the data
and hardware resources and provide dependable performance growth
proportionate to the number of machines available.</p>
