            Information about the Hive lecture and exercise:


  The IntroToHive.pdf file contains lecture slides illustrating the proper use
of Hive. These slides work through an example session and manipulate data
therein. Since the creation of this lecture (and its video recording), the
content in the virtual machine has been reorganized.

  * The primary purpose of including the lecture slides PDF is as a language
    reference by example. The PDF is no longer the current exercise.

  * If you do want to work alongside this lecture, you should do the work in
    the "Getting Familiar with Hadoop" exercise first, to import data into
    HDFS. See exercises/GettingFamiliar.html below this directory.

  * The video online references files in your home directory which may now
    be stored in ~/git/data/.

  * The most up-to-date Hive exercise is stored in the
    exercises/IntroToHive.html file below this directory.
